package isogram

// Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

// An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a
// repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

// Examples of isograms:

// lumberjacks
// background
// downstream
// six-year-old

// The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

func IsIsogram(word string) (int) {
	// declare empty arr
	var arr []string
	// go thru each char in str
	for i := 0; i < len(word); i++ {
		if arr.Con
	}
		// check if that char already exists in arr
			// return False
		// store the char in an arr
